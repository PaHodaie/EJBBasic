EJBBasic
========

EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) is  a part of JEE, EJB is  a server-side model that encapsulates logic of application.
In this example there is a EJB-app that could be based on a JBoss server and 
could be called from a client (through JNDI).
Sorry in this example Dao and Business Logic are in same layer but we can seperate them,  for example if we use Spring.
